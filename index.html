By day, the Hero and the Queen of Mushrooms moved through their quest with cheerful devotion: beer was raised in celebration, and fried bread was consumed — a local delicacy previously unknown to King Juicy Booty, who approached it with the wide-eyed reverence of a man discovering sacred cuisine.

They explored Tahoe-like forests and wandered the trails by the lagoon, where sunlight filtered through green hush and the world felt unusually enchanted. To deepen the beauty of the mission, the couple took a few mushrooms and watched the landscape turn even more mythic. The Witch lurked at the edge of this joy, offended by how easily the ordinary became magical.

As evening arrived, Cozy Boy and his Princess Wife returned to their humble quarters, wind-touched and content — unaware that a sleepy prophecy was waiting to be spoken.`,

The Witch rolled her eyes dramatically at the geometry. Champagne followed. Then more champagne. The newlyweds ventured into the casino, where multiple highly involved rounds of craps unfolded with dramatic enthusiasm. Fortune tilted wildly. Laughter grew louder.

Not the kind carved in marble, but the kind built quietly — dish by dish, load by load, evening by evening. They are building their cozy home together. They are happy in the mundane. In never-ending dishes and laundry. In making food side by side. In reading quietly. In long walks. In cracking — so much cracking. They know each other’s favorite foods without asking. They speak each other’s language without translating. They finish each other’s thoughts, sentences, and occasionally snacks. Slowly, steadily, they are turning into each other… merging into one unstoppable cozy blop. The Witch watches from afar, baffled and mildly offended that joy can be found in such ordinary magic. And still — for all its simplicity — there is a ritual that seals it every time.",

Against all logistical reason, they built a life from ordinary magic: dishes that never end, laundry that multiplies, cooking side by side, quiet reading, long walks, and so much cracking. The kind of love that thrives not in fireworks — but in the mundane.

This level of happiness did not go unnoticed.

The Witch of Long Distance, patron saint of rescheduled plans and inconvenient timing, watched with growing irritation. Peace offended her. Stability insulted her. Cozy domestic bliss was, frankly, unacceptable.

So with dramatic flair and suspiciously precise timing, she struck again.

The Princess Wife was snatched.

And the Witch declared that only true love — proven through memory, devotion, and the gathering of all seven Love Mushrooms — would be powerful enough to bring her back.

The challenge has been issued.`;
